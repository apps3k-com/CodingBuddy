# User Guide (EN)

EnvVarBuddy is a native macOS app for managing the environment variables that live in your zsh dotfiles (`~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`) — without opening a terminal.

## Browsing variables

- The **sidebar** shows *All variables* plus one entry per dotfile with a count badge. Files that don't exist yet are dimmed; adding a variable to one creates it.
- The **table** lists name, value and source file. Use the search field (⌘F) to filter by name or value.
- A 🔒 **lock icon** marks complex lines (command substitution like `$(date)`, multi-assignments like `export A=1 B=2`). EnvVarBuddy shows them honestly but never rewrites them — edit those in your editor of choice.
- An orange **overridden** badge means a later assignment wins: zsh loads `.zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc`, and within a file the last assignment of a name takes effect.

## Editing

- **Double-click** a row (or right-click → *Edit…*) to change name or value. Validation runs live; values are written verbatim — `$VARIABLES` stay unexpanded.
- **＋** in the toolbar adds a new variable. New variables are written into a clearly marked block at the end of the chosen file:

  ```bash
  # >>> EnvVarBuddy >>>
  export MY_VAR="value"
  # <<< EnvVarBuddy <<<
  ```

- **Values with `:`** (like `PATH`) offer *Edit as list*: reorder, add and remove segments by drag & drop.
- **Delete** (right-click → *Delete…*) removes the line after confirmation.

## Safety net

Before every change EnvVarBuddy writes a timestamped backup to
`~/Library/Application Support/EnvVarBuddy/Backups/` (the last 20 per file are kept). Writes are atomic, follow symlinks (dotfile managers stay intact) and preserve file permissions. If a file changed outside the app mid-edit, the write is refused and the view reloads.

## Import & export

- **Import from .env…** reads a dotenv file, shows a preview where you pick the entries (duplicates are flagged), and appends them to the managed block of a file of your choice.
- **Export visible as .env…** writes the variables currently shown in the table to a `.env` file.

## Settings

Open **EnvVarBuddy → Settings…** (⌘,):

- **Language** — System, English or Deutsch. Takes effect after relaunching the app.
- **Appearance** — Auto (follow the system), Light or Dark.

## Live reload

EnvVarBuddy watches your dotfiles. Edits made in a terminal or editor show up in the app within a fraction of a second.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Explanation |
|---|---|
| A variable doesn't show up | Only `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc` are read — not `.bashrc` or files sourced from elsewhere. |
| A row has a lock icon | The line is too complex to rewrite safely. Edit it in a text editor. |
| "The file was changed externally" | Something else modified the dotfile while you edited. The app reloaded — just redo the edit. |
| Restore an old state | Copy the backup from `~/Library/Application Support/EnvVarBuddy/Backups/` over the dotfile. |
